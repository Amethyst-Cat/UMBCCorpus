See the file DescriptorDataTables to find intersection counts for the top 300 descriptors of each pair of perception verbs.

These tables contain descriptors common to two senses and their statistics (OAI, OSI, etc) from both senses. Around 300 of the top descriptors by OAI were intersected for both senses. Set differences or descriptors unique to one sense are also included.

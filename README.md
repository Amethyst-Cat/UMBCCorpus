# UMBCCorpus
A project analyzing sensory descriptors from the [UMBC Corpus](https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2013/05/01/umbc-webbase-corpus-of-3b-english-words/).

## UMBC_analysis Python Notebook
Sections "Fix UMBC Corpus", "Train Word2Vec Model", "Identify Contexts", and "Calculate OAI from CSV" are code taken directly from the project [Mapping the semantic organization of odor vocabulary using natural language data](https://osf.io/zpm5y/). 

Sections "NMF" and "PCA" conduct non-negative matrix factorization and principal component analysis on the pearson distance matrix of the word embeddings for specific descriptors.
